{"description":"People keep implementing map, filter and other fundamental algorithms in different contexts - eagerly over collections, over lazy sequences, in parallel, over enumerables/iterables, over observables, over channels/streams etc. In addition to duplication of effort, this yields bloated APIs, and, when implemented in the classic way, often involves the creation of expensive intermediate objects/values that\ncan be difficult to optimize away.\nMost problematic is that this approach keeps us from composing core algorithms in a context-independent way which would facilitate reuse and engender greater flexibility.\nThis talk will describe transducers, a new library feature for Clojure (but of interest to other languages) that emphasizes composable, context-free, intermediate-free notions like 'mapping' and 'filtering' and their concrete reuse across all of the contexts above.\n\nby Rich Hickey (@richhickey) - Cognitect\n\nRich Hickey, the author of Clojure and designer of Datomic, is a software developer with over 25 years of experience in various domains.
