Lisp marked the beginning of functional programming, interpreters, high-level metaprogramming, garbage collection, and much more. Yet after such auspicious beginnings the idea of Lisp has since faded and many of its innovations have been adopted by much more popular programming languages. Until recently Lisp even appeared doomed to fade into obscurity but several things have conspired to make Lisp somewhat cool again - one of these is Clojure, a fun modern Lisp targeting the Java Virtual Machine.\n\nHowever the Web doesn't speak JVM bytecodes. It speaks JavaScript - thus the cornucopia of languages that now compile to JavaScript. The most well known include GWT, CoffeeScript, and more recently Dart and TypeScript. However none of these represent a real break from the status quo.\n\nJohn McCarthy's insanely great idea still has a lot to offer the Web and we'll see how with ClojureScript, an implementation of Clojure that targets JavaScript. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com","id":"9d97b648-ad8e-42f4-bfe2-420389637f94","meta":{"duration":"PT32M3S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"clojurescript-lisps-revenge-david-nolen","source":{"id":"MTawgp3SKy8","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["Software","Software Development (Industry)","Programming Language (Literary Genre)","Clojure (Programming Language)","Lisp (Programming Language)","JavaSc","JavaScript (Programming Language)","ClojureScript","Conference","GOTO","Presentation (Software Genre)","Java Virtual Machine (Video Game Platform)","David Nolen","GOTOcon","GOTO Conference","Computer Science","Videos for Developers"],"title":"ClojureScript: Lisp's Revenge â€¢ David Nolen","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MTawgp3SKy8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MTawgp3SKy8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MTawgp3SKy8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}}
