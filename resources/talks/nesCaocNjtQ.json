{"description":"http://www.cppcon.org\nâ€”\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\nC++ faces two challenges: Helping programmers address the most demanding tasks in terms of performance, scale, and dependability. It must also help programmers be productive writing ordinary maintainable code. There is much more \"ordinary code\" than there is performance-critical code. Thus, C++ must make simple tasks simple while not getting in the way of tuning software for the last byte and last cycle where that's necessary. This talk focuses on what C++11 and C++14 offers to simplify programming: auto, range-for loops, move semantics, futures, concepts, and more. However, the focus is not primarily on language features: the key is programming: how can we write better, more readable, efficient, and more maintainable code? If you think that the essence of C++ is clever pointer manipulation and huge class hierarchies you may be in for a few surprises.\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com","id":"d42ee48e-77ad-429a-bce2-f5e716b2ea6f","meta":{"duration":"PT1H37M36S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"cppcon-2014-bjarne-stroustrup-make-simple-tasks-simple","source":{"id":"nesCaocNjtQ","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["CppCon 2014","Bjarne Stroustrup","Make Simple Tasks Simple!","Computer Science (Field of Study)","C (Programming Language)","Bash Films","Conference Video Recording","Event Video Recording","Video Conferencing","video conferencing equipment","videoconference","video services"],"title":"CppCon 2014: Bjarne Stroustrup \"Make Simple Tasks Simple!\"","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nesCaocNjtQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nesCaocNjtQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nesCaocNjtQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}}
