I love trying them out, and I love thinking about their design and implementation. (I know, it’s sad.)\n\nI came across Ruby in 1998 because I was an avid reader of comp.lang.misc (ask your parents). I downloaded it, compiled it, and fell in love. As with any time you fall in love, it’s difficult to explain why. It just worked the way I work, and it had enough depth to keep me interested.\n\nFast forward 15 years. All that time I’d been looking for something new that gave me the same feeling. Then I came across Elixir, a language by José Valim, that puts a humane, Ruby-like syntax on the Erlang VM.\n\nNow I’m dangerous. I want other people to see just how great this is. I want to evangelize. So come along and let me show you the things that I think make Elixir a serious alternative for writing highly reliable, scalable, and performant server code.\n\nAnd, more important, let me show you some fun stuff.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com","id":"65402d14-ad8e-4abd-847a-8db68a7b845b","meta":{"duration":"PT49M42S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"elixir-the-power-of-erlang-the-joy-of-ruby-dave-thomas","source":{"id":"lww1aZ-ldz0","provider":"youtube"},"tag":[],"title":"Elixir: The Power of Erlang, the Joy of Ruby • Dave Thomas","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lww1aZ-ldz0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lww1aZ-ldz0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lww1aZ-ldz0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}}
